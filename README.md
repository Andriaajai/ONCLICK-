Repository for Hackathon(screening test).


In this project, we try to implement a review analysis system which can be used in schools and colleges so that every student can express their opinions about the teaching stratergies and methodologies of a teacher in sentences rather than rating it on the basis of stars. All students are free to give out their feedbacks through this system. After getting the opinions as the input, we will be analysing the response on the basis of the meaning of the words used to describe the teacher. After the analysis, the whole reponse will be reviewed whether it was a good impression or a bad impression. In this way, any student can enter their valuable opinions as responses about a teacher and rate them as good or bad. Finally, the whole rating on a teacher will be shown to the one required.
