Repository for Hackathon(screening test).


Here throgh this project we are trying to implement a review analyser that can be used in schools and colleges so that each student can enter their resposes about the teaching stratergies about a teacher as sentences rather than rating it on the basis of stars.Each students are free to give their opinions through this project.Then we will be analysing the response basing on the meaning of the words used to describe the teacher.After analyzing the whole reponse we will be reviewing whether it was a good one or a bad one.Such a way any number of students can enter their responses about a teacher.Atlast the whole ratings about a teacher will be shown to the one required.
